# Data structures in Oz
Some data structures implemented in Oz:
- Stack (create a new stack, push and pop elements, see its size, sum the elements and check if it's empty)
- Dictionary (create a new dictionary, insert elements, get element by key, see its size, check if it's empty and see all its keys)
- Tree
